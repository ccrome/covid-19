# Covid-19 by county
This is a little script that generates covid-19 data, based on the
idea from this [Minute Physics Video]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc), which is based on the
data  from [Aatish Bhatia](https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/)

I run this script every hour, which updates data from the [New York
Times Dataset](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data.git)
